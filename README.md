<h2>New Beginnings: An Integrated Productivity System</h2>

<h4>I developed "New Beginnings," a comprehensive productivity system that combines habit building, goal tracking, and progress journaling into one cohesive platform. The system helps users create sustainable habits, achieve meaningful goals, and maintain a reflective practice through integrated tracking and visualization. I used github Copilot for this process and it made me super easy to build everything just in few hours.</h4>

<h3>Key Features of the system: </h3>

<p>Habit Builder: A streak-based system for building consistent habits with visual progress indicators</p>
<p>Goal Tracking: Break down and track long-term goals with interactive progress visualization</p>
<p>Progress Journal: A reflective space that combines mood tracking, metrics, and written entries</p>
<p>Cross-Feature Integration: All components work together to provide comprehensive progress insights</p>
